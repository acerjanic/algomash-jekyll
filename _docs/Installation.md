## Install Jekyll
{: .content-subhead }

Installing Jekyll is very easy. Jekyll is a blog-aware CMS that converts your markdown files into webpages with a little configuration. No databases and servers to maintain.

Installation procedure is given in detail on [Jekyll website](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). It's available for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

For Mac OSX or Linux, you can use [Bundle](http://bundler.io) to setup the GitHub-pages version of Jekyll.

  bundle install

## Download Algomash
{: .content-subhead }

Once you've Jekyll installed, you can start creating your documentation website with Algomash on your machine and can upload on the server later.

To download Algomash, go to [Algomash GitHub page](https://github.com/deepakbansal/algomash-jekyll) and click "Download Zip" on the right side of the page.

If you would like to use git to host your website on GitHub Pages you can also click "Clone on Desktop" given that you've got git installed.
