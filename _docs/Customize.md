Algomash uses [Pure.css](http://purecss.io/), a front-end library by Yahoo! Inc. It's licensed under the [Yahoo BSD License](https://github.com/yahoo/pure-site/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

You can **completely** customize Algomash. Let's look at a few cool ways.

## Learn Pure.css
{: .content-subhead }

Pure.css is very light-weight and easy to learn UI library. It's created by Yahoo's YUI team. To learn Pure.css, head on to [official documentation](http://purecss.io/base/).

Check out all the classes and ids you can use. They also have sample layouts. In fact, Algomash uses only 2 layouts!

## Use Some Other Front-end Framework
{: .content-subhead }

If you're going to change the design completely, one way is using some other framework. This is the best option, if you're already familiar with a front-end framework. In the main directory you just need to edit the files in the `_includes` folder. You can use the classes of this framework while adding content.

Some of the most popular are:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/)

## Write CSS/JS Yourself
{: .content-subhead }

If none of the frameworks fullfil your requirements or for whatever reason, you can also write your own CSS and JavaScript.

## Edit Menus
{: .content-subhead }

You can edit the menu on index page by going to `_includes/header-index.html`. It shows the homepage and any other pages like project homepages in the menu. Custom links can be added easily.

Jekyll supports markdown and textile for posts.
